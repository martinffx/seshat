# Seshat Project Roadmap

## Overview
Our roadmap is structured into four progressive phases, each building upon the previous implementation and expanding the system's capabilities.

## Phase 1: Single Shard Cluster (MVP)
- Focus: Core distributed systems patterns
- Key Deliverables:
  - ✅ Redis RESP protocol support (100% complete - 39.9 hours)
  - ⏳ Raft consensus implementation (0% - 19 hours estimated)
  - ⏳ RocksDB storage (0% - 20 hours estimated)
  - ⏳ Chaos testing (0% - 20 hours estimated)
  - Basic cluster formation
  - Leader election
- Status: **In Progress** - 1/4 features complete (25%)
- Progress: 38.4% by effort (39.9 of 104 estimated hours)
- Timeline: 7-10 working days remaining at current velocity

### Phase 1 Progress Detail
| Feature | Status | Effort | Tests | Priority |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| RESP Protocol | ✅ Complete | 39.9h | 487 passing | - |
| Raft Consensus | ⏳ Not Started | 19h est | 0 | **P1 - BLOCKER** |
| RocksDB Storage | ⏳ Not Started | 20h est | 0 | P2 - Required |
| Chaos Testing | ⏳ Not Started | 20h est | 0 | P3 - Validation |

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Start Raft Consensus immediately** - Critical path blocker for all integration work
2. RocksDB Storage - Required for persistence layer
3. Chaos Testing - Final validation of distributed system properties

## Phase 2: Multi-Shard Cluster
- Focus: Horizontal scalability
- Key Deliverables:
  - Consistent hashing
  - Shard allocation strategies
  - Dynamic shard rebalancing
  - Cross-shard operation support

## Phase 3: Dynamic Cluster Management
- Focus: Operational flexibility
- Key Deliverables:
  - Node addition/removal
  - Automatic rebalancing
  - Dynamic configuration updates
  - Advanced failure recovery

## Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Focus: Enterprise-grade features
- Key Deliverables:
  - Advanced monitoring
  - Comprehensive security model
  - Multi-datacenter replication
  - Compliance and certification
  - Performance optimizations

## Phase 5: SQL Interface
- Focus: Multi-protocol support
- Key Deliverables:
  - PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation (`protocol-sql` crate)
  - SQL service layer (`sql` crate)
  - Query planning and optimization
  - Transaction management
  - Schema validation
  - SQL storage using RocksDB column families
  - **Operator-configurable deployment**: Single RocksDB (simple) vs separate instances (isolated)
