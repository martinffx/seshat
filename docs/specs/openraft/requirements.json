  "raw_user_story": "As a Seshat developer, I want to migrate from raft-rs to openraft so that we eliminate outdated transitive prost dependencies and gain a better-maintained Raft implementation",
  "raw_criteria": [
    "openraft replaces raft-rs removing the outdated transitive prost dependency",
    "All existing Raft functionality (leader election, log replication) works with openraft",
    "RocksDB storage backend integrates with openraft's storage trait"
  ],
  "raw_rules": [
    "Must maintain compatibility with existing storage layer (6 RocksDB column families)",
    "Must support gRPC transport for inter-node communication",
    "Must preserve log compaction and snapshot capabilities"
  ],
  "raw_scope": {
    "included": [
      "Replace raft-rs dependency with openraft",
      "Implement openraft storage trait using RocksDB",
      "Implement gRPC transport layer for inter-node communication",
      "Update raft/ crate implementation",
      "Replace in-memory KV with RocksDB-backed storage"
    ],
    "excluded": [
      "Changes to KV service layer or RESP protocol",
      "New Raft features beyond current raft-rs functionality",
      "Performance optimizations beyond maintaining current benchmarks",
      "Storage schema changes"
    ]
  },
  "context_notes": "Current implementation uses in-memory KV store. RESP protocol not yet connected to Raft. Need to implement both gRPC inter-node communication and RocksDB persistence as part of migration."
